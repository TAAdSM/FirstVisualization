# Teo's First Visualization in ThreeJS

## To run:
1. Clone this repo
2. At the project root: `npm install`
`npm run start`
3. View dist/index.html in your browser.

## For development
I would recommend just using `npm run start` and manually re-calling this 
each time a code change is made. I have yet to solve the problem of having the 
nodemon call conserve the number of tabs to just one. But, if you have a mac
, you may play around with it:
1. `npm install -g nodemon` 
2. `nodemon --ignore ./dist --exec npm run start`

## Here's a look at the current state of the visualization:
